# Mochi Cards Learning Templates
A collection of flashcard templates for [Mochi Cards](https://mochi.cards/), designed to maximize retention and understanding.

## Design Principles
These templates try to adhere to the principles of instructional design found in Dr. Piotr Wozniak’s *[Twenty Rules of Formulating Knowledge](https://www.supermemo.com/en/blog/twenty-rules-of-formulating-knowledge)*, such as:
1. **Minimum Information Principle:** each card should contain one simple idea or concept.
2. **Contextual Cues:** card fields should be designed and positioned to prevent interference and provide context for the main idea.
3. **Active Recall:** cards should encourage active recall and not passive recognition.
